## Application

### Goal
The target state for the first development phase is to have all my compilations available on the webserver,
being able to navigate in between collections to songs to artists. Importantly, the application will expose interesting facts about the collections such as popular artists, popular genres, duplicate songs etc.
A more comprehensive list is available in [Development](Development.md)  - stats features.
